# Parkinson's Disease classification 

A deep learning project for Parkinson's Disease classification using multimodal data (audio and facial frames) scraped from YouTube videos of Parkinson's patients. This project explores how multimodal models can be used to analyze voice and facial data for early detection or classification of Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms.

## üß† Overview

Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects both motor and non-motor functions, many of which can be observed through speech patterns and facial expressions. This project leverages publicly available video content to extract:

- **Audio Segments** ‚Äî capturing vocal features
- **Face Frames** ‚Äî capturing micro-expressions and facial cues

These modalities are processed and fed into a multimodal  models for classification.
